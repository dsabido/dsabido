<h1> Dubai</h1>

Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE). It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and 
is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one of the seven emirates
 that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two 
 emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national 
 importance in the country's legislature. The city of Dubai is
  located on the emirate's northern coastline and heads up the
   Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai is to host World 
   Expo 2020. Dubai has emerged as a global city and business
    hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub for 
    passengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was based 
    on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration
     concessions, but oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue
      first started to flow in 1969. Dubai's oil revenue helped 
      accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves 
      are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5%
       of the emirate's revenue comes from oil
